# Testing & Verification Guide: TV Time Giver (AI Edition)

This guide outlines the protocol to verify that the app correctly counts exercises, enforces time limits, and handles the email approval workflow.

## 1. Camera & Environment Setup
**Protocol:**
-   **Lighting**: Ensure the room is well-lit. Avoid backlighting (windows behind you).
-   **Position**: Place camera at waist height (~3 feet high).
-   **Distance**: Stand 6-8 feet away so your **whole body** (head to feet) is visible.
-   **Verification**: Look for the "Status Dot" in the top-left of the camera view. It should be **Green**.

## 2. Exercise Accuracy Tests
Perform these reps to verify AI Counting.

### Test A: Jumping Jacks (New)
1.  **Select Mode**: Click "Jumping Jacks".
2.  **Action**: 
    -   Start with hands at sides, feet together.
    -   Jump to: Hands above head, feet wide.
    -   Return to start.
3.  **Expected**: Counter increments by 1. Voice says "1".
4.  **Feedback Check**: Do a "lazy" jack (hands not high enough). Voice should NOT count.

### Test B: Squat Form (Before 7 AM)
1.  **Select Mode**: Click "Squats".
2.  **Action**: Squat down until thighs are parallel to the floor.
3.  **Expected**: Counter increments. Voice says "1".
4.  **Feedback Check**: Go halfway down. Voice should say "Deeper!".

## 3. Logic & Rules Verification

### Test C: The "7 AM" Rule
*Since we cannot easily change real time, verify based on current time.*
-   **If Before 7 AM**: 
    -   Multiplier Badge says "Early Bird: 100%".
    -   Squats Button is **Active**.
-   **If After 7 AM**:
    -   Multiplier Badge says "Standard: 50%".
    -   Squats Button is **Dimmed / Locked**.

### Test D: Empty Report Block
1.  **Action**: Launch the app (or refresh). Counter is 0.0.
2.  **Action**: Click "Finish & Report" button.
3.  **Expected**: Alert popup says "You haven't earned any time yet!". Email DOES NOT open.

## 4. Email & Approval Workflow Verification

### Test E: Full Success Flow
1.  **Pre-req**: Earn at least 0.1 minutes (do a few jumping jacks).
2.  **Action**: Click "Finish & Report".
3.  **Verification**: 
    -   Default Mail App opens.
    -   **To**: `venky24aug@gmail.com`
    -   **Subject**: `tv time by ai`
    -   **Body**: Contains "hi venkat/papa..." and your stats.
4.  **Action (App Side)**: App shows "Waiting for Approval" screen.
5.  **Action (Parent)**: Click "Approve (Watch TV)".
6.  **Expected**: Screen turns Green ("Watch TV Today").

### Test F: Decline Flow
1.  Repeat steps 1-4.
2.  **Action (Parent)**: Click "Decline (No TV)".
3.  **Expected**: Screen turns Red ("No TV Today").

## 5. Deployment / Handover
-   **File Location**: Ensure [index.html](file:///C:/Users/hi%20coder/.gemini/antigravity/brain/cb0f6429-b178-4e8f-9b39-4dffcef35e2d/index.html), [script.js](file:///C:/Users/hi%20coder/.gemini/antigravity/brain/cb0f6429-b178-4e8f-9b39-4dffcef35e2d/script.js), and [style.css](file:///C:/Users/hi%20coder/.gemini/antigravity/brain/cb0f6429-b178-4e8f-9b39-4dffcef35e2d/style.css) are in the user's Desktop folder.
