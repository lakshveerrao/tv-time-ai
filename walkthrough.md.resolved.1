## How to Verify (User Manual)

### 1. Setup
1.  Ensure you have the following 3 files in the **SAME** folder on your computer:
    -   [index.html](file:///C:/Users/hi%20coder/.gemini/antigravity/brain/cb0f6429-b178-4e8f-9b39-4dffcef35e2d/index.html)
    -   [style.css](file:///C:/Users/hi%20coder/.gemini/antigravity/brain/cb0f6429-b178-4e8f-9b39-4dffcef35e2d/style.css)
    -   [script.js](file:///C:/Users/hi%20coder/.gemini/antigravity/brain/cb0f6429-b178-4e8f-9b39-4dffcef35e2d/script.js)
2.  Open [index.html](file:///C:/Users/hi%20coder/.gemini/antigravity/brain/cb0f6429-b178-4e8f-9b39-4dffcef35e2d/index.html) in a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).
3.  **Allow Camera Permissions** when prompted.

### 2. Verify Exercise Counting
1.  **Select "Pushups"**:
    -   Stand back so the camera sees your full body (head to toe sideways is best).
    -   Perform a pushup.
    -   **Check**: Does the "Reps" counter go up? (It counts when you go DOWN and come back UP).
    -   **Check**: Does the "Form" feedback update?
2.  **Select "Squats"**:
    -   Face the camera or stand sideways.
    -   Squat down until your knees are bent.
    -   **Check**: Does the counter increment?

### 3. Verify Timers
1.  Select **"Running"**.
2.  Click **"2 Min"**.
3.  **Check**: Does the timer start counting down?
4.  **Check**: When finished, is exactly 2 minutes (or 1 min adjusted) added to your total?

### 4. Verify Time-of-Day Logic
-   Look at the **Badge** in the top right.
-   **If currently before 7 AM**: It should say "Early Bird (100%)".
-   **If currently after 7 AM**: It should say "Standard (50%)".
-   *Test*: Add a custom condition for "10 min".
    -   If Early Bird: You get 10 mins.
    -   If Standard: You get 5 mins.

## Troubleshooting
-   **Camera not starting?** Refresh the page and ensure no other app is using the camera.
-   **Not counting?** Ensure lighting is good and your full body is visible. The AI needs to see your joints (shoulders, elbows, hips, knees).

## Verification Proof
