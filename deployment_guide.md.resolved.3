# 🚀 Deployment Guide: Hosting "TV Time AI"

Since your app is built with **Static Web Technologies** (HTML, CSS, JS), you can host it for free on platforms like **Netlify** or **GitHub Pages**.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL FIRST STEP: Google Authentication Consideration
Your app uses **Google Sign-In**. Google currently only trusts `localhost` (your computer). 
**When you move to a real domain (like `myapp.netlify.app`), Google will BLOCK the login until you authorize that new domain.**

## Option 1: The Magic Command (✨ Recommended)
Since you have **Node.js** installed, this is the fastest way.

1.  Open your terminal (PowerShell/CMD).
2.  Type this command and hit Enter:
    ```powershell
    npx vercel
    ```
3.  Follow the prompts:
    *   Set up and deploy? **Y**
    *   Which scope? (Press **Enter**)
    *   Link to existing project? **N**
    *   Project name? (Press **Enter**)
    *   Directory? (Press **Enter**)
4.  Wait ~30 seconds. It will give you a **Production URL** (e.g., `https://tv-time-app.vercel.app`).
5.  **Copy that URL.**

## Option 2: GitHub Pages (Good if you have a GitHub account)

---

## Option 2: GitHub Pages (Good if you have a GitHub account)
1.  Go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new) and create a repository named `tv-time-app`.
2.  **Upload Files**: Click "uploading an existing file" and drag all files from your folder to GitHub. Commit changes.
3.  **Activate Pages**:
    *   Go to **Settings** > **Pages**.
    *   Under "Source", select `main` branch and `/root` folder.
    *   Click **Save**.
4.  Your URL will be `https://<username>.github.io/tv-time-app`.

---

## Option 3: Vercel (Fast & Premium)
1.  Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new).
2.  Import your GitHub repository (if you used Option 2) OR use the Vercel CLI.
3.  Vercel gives excellent speeds and distinct URLs (e.g., `tv-time.vercel.app`).

---

## Option 4: Tiiny.host (The Absolute Simplest)
1.  Go to [tiiny.host](https://tiiny.host).
2.  Drag and drop your **project folder** or **ZIP file** directly onto the homepage.
3.  Enter a link name.
4.  Click **Upload**.

---

## 🔒 MANDATORY: Update Google Cloud Console
**The app will NOT let you log in yet.** You must tell Google that this new URL is safe.

1.  Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).
2.  Select your Project ("TV Time").
3.  Click on your **OAuth 2.0 Client ID** (the one you created for this app).
4.  Look for **"Authorized JavaScript origins"**.
5.  Click **"ADD URI"** and paste your new Netlify URL (e.g., `https://rad-sunflower-12345.netlify.app`).
    *   *Note: Do not put a trailing slash `/` at the end.*
6.  Look for **"Authorized redirect URIs"**.
7.  Click **"ADD URI"** and paste the same URL.
8.  Click **SAVE**.

> ⏳ **Wait 5-10 minutes.** Google updates can take a few moments to propagate.

---

## Verify Deployment
1.  Open your new Netlify URL on your phone or computer.
2.  Click **"Sign in with Google"**.
3.  If it works -> **SUCCESS!** 🎉
4.  If you get an error (`400: redirect_uri_mismatch`), double-check Step 2 (exact URL matching).

---

## Troubleshooting
*   **"Error 403: access_denied"**: You forgot to add the user to the "Test Users" list in Google Cloud (if your app is still in "Testing" mode).
*   **Camera not working**: Ensure your site is served over **HTTPS** (Netlify does this automatically). Camera access is blocked on HTTP.
