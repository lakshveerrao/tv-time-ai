# TV Time Giver App - CV Edition Implementation Plan

## Goal
Build a premium web application that uses **Computer Vision (webcam)** to automatically count exercises and award TV time.

## User Review Required
- **Webcam Usage**: The app will require camera access. All processing is done locally in your browser (privacy focused).
- **Complexity**: This is a more complex app. I will split it into 3 files ([index.html](file:///C:/Users/hi%20coder/.gemini/antigravity/brain/cb0f6429-b178-4e8f-9b39-4dffcef35e2d/index.html), [script.js](file:///C:/Users/hi%20coder/.gemini/antigravity/brain/cb0f6429-b178-4e8f-9b39-4dffcef35e2d/script.js), [style.css](file:///C:/Users/hi%20coder/.gemini/antigravity/brain/cb0f6429-b178-4e8f-9b39-4dffcef35e2d/style.css)) in the artifacts folder, which you can keep together in a folder on your desktop.

## Proposed Features (Pure AI Edition)

### 1. Advanced Computer Vision (MediaPipe)
-   **Jumping Jacks**: Detect Arms Up/Legs Out vs Arms Down/Legs In.
-   **Form Correction**: 
    -   Calculate angles real-time.
    -   If angles assume "Bad Form" state, trigger TTS (Text-to-Speech).
    -   Example: Pushup depth check -> "Lower!".

### 2. AI Interaction
-   **Voice Coach**: Uses `window.speechSynthesis` to speak feedback.
-   **Chatbot**: A rule-based text interface for "Asking questions on workout and tv".
    -   Knowledge base: Tips for exercises, rules of the app, form guides.

### 3. Removal of "Manual" Features
-   Remove "Input Count" box.
-   Remove "Running" timer (Replaced by Jumping Jacks).
-   Remove "Custom Condition" input.
-   **Strict**: Only AI counted reps add time.

### 4. File Structure
Same 3-file structure ([index.html](file:///C:/Users/hi%20coder/.gemini/antigravity/brain/cb0f6429-b178-4e8f-9b39-4dffcef35e2d/index.html), [script.js](file:///C:/Users/hi%20coder/.gemini/antigravity/brain/cb0f6429-b178-4e8f-9b39-4dffcef35e2d/script.js), [style.css](file:///C:/Users/hi%20coder/.gemini/antigravity/brain/cb0f6429-b178-4e8f-9b39-4dffcef35e2d/style.css)), but significant logic rewrite.

## Verification Plan
### Automated Tests
- Unit tests for the "Angle Calculation" functions.

### Manual Verification
- I will launch the app and perform a walkthrough of the new AI features.
- Test Voice Feedback (needs browser audio).
- Test Chatbot responses.
