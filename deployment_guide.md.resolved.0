# 🚀 Deployment Guide: Hosting "TV Time AI"

Since your app is built with **Static Web Technologies** (HTML, CSS, JS), you can host it for free on platforms like **Netlify** or **GitHub Pages**.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL FIRST STEP: Google Authentication Consideration
Your app uses **Google Sign-In**. Google currently only trusts `localhost` (your computer). 
**When you move to a real domain (like `myapp.netlify.app`), Google will BLOCK the login until you authorize that new domain.**

---

## Option 1: The Easiest Way (Netlify Drop)
**Recommended for quick results.**

### Step 1: Prepare your Folder
1.  Open your File Explorer to the folder containing your project files:
    `C:\Users\hi coder\.gemini\antigravity\brain\cb0f6429-b178-4e8f-9b39-4dffcef35e2d`
2.  Ensure `index.html` is in this folder (it is).

### Step 2: Drag & Drop
1.  Go to [app.netlify.com/drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop).
2.  Drag and drop your **entire project folder** onto the page.
3.  Netlify will upload it and give you a random URL (e.g., `https://rad-sunflower-12345.netlify.app`).
4.  **COPY THIS URL.**

---

## 🔒 MANDATORY: Update Google Cloud Console
**The app will NOT let you log in yet.** You must tell Google that this new URL is safe.

1.  Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).
2.  Select your Project ("TV Time").
3.  Click on your **OAuth 2.0 Client ID** (the one you created for this app).
4.  Look for **"Authorized JavaScript origins"**.
5.  Click **"ADD URI"** and paste your new Netlify URL (e.g., `https://rad-sunflower-12345.netlify.app`).
    *   *Note: Do not put a trailing slash `/` at the end.*
6.  Look for **"Authorized redirect URIs"**.
7.  Click **"ADD URI"** and paste the same URL.
8.  Click **SAVE**.

> ⏳ **Wait 5-10 minutes.** Google updates can take a few moments to propagate.

---

## Verify Deployment
1.  Open your new Netlify URL on your phone or computer.
2.  Click **"Sign in with Google"**.
3.  If it works -> **SUCCESS!** 🎉
4.  If you get an error (`400: redirect_uri_mismatch`), double-check Step 2 (exact URL matching).

---

## Troubleshooting
*   **"Error 403: access_denied"**: You forgot to add the user to the "Test Users" list in Google Cloud (if your app is still in "Testing" mode).
*   **Camera not working**: Ensure your site is served over **HTTPS** (Netlify does this automatically). Camera access is blocked on HTTP.
