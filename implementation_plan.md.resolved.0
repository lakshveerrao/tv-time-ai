# TV Time Giver App Implementation Plan

## Goal
Build a premium web application to track exercises and calculate earned TV time based on your handwritten rules.

## User Review Required
- **Location**: I plan to create the app in `C:/Users/hi coder/tv-time-giver`. Alternatively, I can generate a single-file HTML/JS app if you prefer not to have a full Node.js project.
- **Microphone/Camera**: The app will rely on *manual input* (typing counts or starting timers) as per the "Record -> Submit" flow in your notes. If you intended for the app to *automatically count* using the camera (computer vision), please let me know! (The "Groundnut" app context suggests you interest in CV, but your notes here say "Record -> Submit", so I will assume manual entry for now unless specified).

## Proposed Features

### 1. Exercise Tracker
Users can select an exercise and input data:
- **Pushups**: Input count (5 reps = 1 min TV)
- **Squats**: Input count (10 reps = 1 min TV)
- **Crunches**: Input count (10 reps = 1 min TV)
- **On-Spot Run**: Timer (1 min run = 1 min TV)
- **Planks**: Timer (1 min plank = 1 min TV)

### 2. Logic Engine
- **Time Check**: 
    - If current time < 7:00 AM: 100% Credit.
    - If current time >= 7:00 AM: 50% Credit.
- **Daily Cap**: Enforce a maximum of 10 minutes of *earned* TV time per day.

### 3. User Interface
- **Dashboard**: Shows "TV Time Earned Today", "Remaining Capacity", and a list of exercises.
- **Aesthetics**: Premium dark mode, large buttons, smooth animations, appropriate for a daily use tool.

## Verification Plan
### Automated Tests
- Unit tests for the calculator logic (e.g., input 10 squats after 7am -> verify 0.5 min earned).

### Manual Verification
- I will launch the app and perform a walkthrough of adding each exercise and checking the generated time.
