# TV Time Giver (AI Edition) - Instructional Manual

## Philosophy: Pure AI
This app is designed to be a "Zero Touch" experience during workouts. 
-   **No Manual Entry**: You cannot type in your reps. You must do them.
-   **Live Correction**: The AI watches your form in real-time and speaks to you to correct it (e.g., "Go Lower", "Straighten Back").
-   **Smart Counting**: Reps are only counted if your form is good.

## Exercises & Rules

### 1. Jumping Jacks (New!)
-   **Goal**: 20 Reps = 1 Minute of TV Time.
-   **AI Detection**:
    -   **Start**: Arms DOWN (near hips), Legs IN (together).
    -   **Middle**: Arms UP (over head), Legs OUT (wide stance).
    -   **End**: Return to Start.
-   **Form Tips**: Ensure your hands clap or touch above your head. Jump your feet wide.

### 2. Pushups
-   **Rate**: 5 Reps = 1 Minute of TV Time.
-   **AI Detection**: 
    -   Tracks elbow angle.
    -   **Correction**: If you don't go down continuously (>90 degrees), the AI will tell you "Go Lower".

### 3. Squats
-   **Rate**: 10 Reps = 1 Minute of TV Time.
-   **AI Detection**: 
    -   Tracks knee/hip angle.
    -   **Correction**: Must break parallel (thighs parallel to floor).

### 4. Crunches
-   **Rate**: 10 Reps = 1 Minute of TV Time.
-   **AI Detection**: 
    -   Tracks shoulder movement relative to hips.
    -   **Correction**: "Lift Shoulders Higher" if you just nod your head.

## AI Assistant (Q&A)
-   You can ask the AI questions like:
    -   "How do I do a squat?"
    -   "What is the daily limit?"
    -   "Why didn't that rep count?"
-   Only ask questions related to Workout and TV rules.

## Technical Explanations
-   **Privacy**: All video processing happens LOCALLY on your device. No images are sent to the cloud.
-   **Lighting**: Ensure you are in a well-lit room.
-   **Camera**: Place camera at waist height if possible, far enough to see your whole body.
