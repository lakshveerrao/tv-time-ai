# TV Time Giver (AI Edition) - Instructional Manual

## Philosophy: Pure AI
This app is designed to be a "Zero Touch" experience during workouts. 
-   **No Manual Entry**: You cannot type in your reps. You must do them.
-   **Live Correction**: The AI watches your form in real-time and speaks to you to correct it (e.g., "Go Lower", "Straighten Back").
-   **Smart Counting**: Reps are only counted if your form is good.
