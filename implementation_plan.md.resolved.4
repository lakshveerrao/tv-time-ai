# TV Time Giver App - CV Edition Implementation Plan

## Goal
Build a premium web application that uses **Computer Vision (webcam)** to automatically count exercises and award TV time.

## User Review Required
- **Webcam Usage**: The app will require camera access. All processing is done locally in your browser (privacy focused).
- **Complexity**: This is a more complex app. I will split it into 3 files ([index.html](file:///C:/Users/hi%20coder/.gemini/antigravity/brain/cb0f6429-b178-4e8f-9b39-4dffcef35e2d/index.html), [script.js](file:///C:/Users/hi%20coder/.gemini/antigravity/brain/cb0f6429-b178-4e8f-9b39-4dffcef35e2d/script.js), [style.css](file:///C:/Users/hi%20coder/.gemini/antigravity/brain/cb0f6429-b178-4e8f-9b39-4dffcef35e2d/style.css)) in the artifacts folder, which you can keep together in a folder on your desktop.

-   **Approval Screen**: 
    -   Apps enters "Waiting" state.
    -   Shows "Approve" (Green) and "Decline" (Red) buttons (Simulating Parent).
    -   **Approved**: Shows "Watch TV" screen.
    -   **Declined**: Shows "No TV" screen.

### 4. File Structure
Same 3-file structure ([index.html](file:///C:/Users/hi%20coder/.gemini/antigravity/brain/cb0f6429-b178-4e8f-9b39-4dffcef35e2d/index.html), [script.js](file:///C:/Users/hi%20coder/.gemini/antigravity/brain/cb0f6429-b178-4e8f-9b39-4dffcef35e2d/script.js), [style.css](file:///C:/Users/hi%20coder/.gemini/antigravity/brain/cb0f6429-b178-4e8f-9b39-4dffcef35e2d/style.css)), but significant logic rewrite.

## Verification Plan
### Automated Tests
- Unit tests for the "Angle Calculation" functions.

### Manual Verification
- I will launch the app and perform a walkthrough of the new AI features.
- Test Voice Feedback (needs browser audio).
- Test Chatbot responses.
